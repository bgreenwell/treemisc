\description{
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine \code{class = 1} 
and forged \code{class = 0} banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an 
industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final 
images contained 400 x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the 
investigated object, gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi 
were gained. Wavelet transformation tools were used to extract features from 
the images.
