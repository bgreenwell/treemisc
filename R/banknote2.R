#' Swiss banknote data (UCI version)
#'
#' Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine \code{class = 1} 
#' and forged \code{class = 0} banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an 
#' industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final 
#' images contained 400 x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the 
#' investigated object, gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi 
#' were gained. Wavelet transformation tools were used to extract features from 
#' the images.
